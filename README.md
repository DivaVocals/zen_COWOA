This module lets your customer checkout without having to register an account on your store. (Guest checkout)

It comes with a couple of additional (optional) modifications that let you see who used COWOA to checkout with and let's those customers who used COWOA to still be able to track the Order Status of their order by using the e-mail name they used during checkout and the OrderID number.

Originally written by KGZotU (Joe Schilz)back in February 2007 and has been modified a few times by others.
